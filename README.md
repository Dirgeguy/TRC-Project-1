Assumptions:
1. The data set for covid has significant numbers that can be used for study starting from March 1st. So, underlying assumption is that are no cases before March 1st 2020.

Limitations:
1. The common stocks picked for study in each sector are very random and may not cover the full scope of the sector.

Structure of study:

Step 1: Market Analysis of ETFs from 11 sectors and the SPY index for the two different time frames.

Step 2: Evaluating the impact of pandemic on the markets for the two time frames.

Step 3: Comparing ETF and common stocks of all the 11 sectors along with SPY index for the two time frames and analysing any difference in correlation with covid data.

Statistical methods used:

1. Correlation analysis
2. Standard deviation
3. Beta - to calculate volatility
4. Sharpe ratio - to calculate return per unit of risk

Visual representations used:

1. Heatmap
2. Boxplot
3. scatter diagram
4. Interactive hvplot
5. **Panel dashboard**

The following analysis has been deduced:
